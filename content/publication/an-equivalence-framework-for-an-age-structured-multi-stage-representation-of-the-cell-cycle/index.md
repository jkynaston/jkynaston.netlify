abstract: "We develop theoretical equivalences between stochastic and
  deterministic models for populations of individual cells stratified by age.
  Specifically, we develop a hierarchical system of equations describing the
  full dynamics of an age-structured multi-stage Markov process for
  approximating cell cycle time distributions. We further demonstrate that the
  resulting mean behaviour is equivalent, over large timescales, to the
  classical McKendrick-von Foerster integro-partial differential equation. We
  conclude by extending this framework to a spatial context, facilitating the
  modelling of travelling wave phenomena and cell-mediated pattern formation.
  More generally, this methodology may be extended to myriad reaction-diffusion
  processes for which the age of individuals is relevant to the dynamics. "
